# Help of Offline Program Judge

1.Put your code in "ans.cpp" which is in the folder where the Program Judge.exe is located.

2.Please create a file called"testpoint.in" which contains those infomation below:
```
test_point:1,
time_lim=1000;
test_point:2,
time_lim=1000;
```

and put it in a folder named "stat" where the test point files are located.

3.The name of test point file only supports numbers(1,2,3,4,...), and make sure every ".in" file is paired with its ".out" file.

There is an example "stat" folder in the repository.

4.This program uses MinGW g++ compiler,please download it in advance, or you can download Dev C++ to finish this step.

5.The result of the program will output in the console.

6.Up to now the result only has WA(wrong answer),AC(accepted),CE(compile error),RE(runtime error) and TLE(time limited exceed),

which I will continue to update.

Goals for next version:
1.GUI
2.MLE
